Project 3
By: Sijie Shang and Claire Rhoda

About:
Our Project 3 contains one C++17 file (main.cpp) that carries out two programs.
Each program takes at least two parameters that include an integer n and an uint64_t x.
The purpose of the programs is to find the root of the nth that is equal to x.
The first program achieves this by using exhaustive search and the second program finds 
the root by using a bisection method that implements a decrease-by-half algorithm.
Although each program returns the same root, we compare both methods to see how many loops 
were done for the exhaustive algorithm and for the decrease-by-half algorithm. 

Installation:
Download this project as .tar and extract it.
Open the folder that has the main.cpp file and open a command window.
In terminal, type command: make all to compile the code
In terminal, type command: make run to run the program
In terminal, type command: make clean to delete the compiled execution

Project status:
All portions of our project carry out the required tasks.

Makefile Commands:
make all : to compile the program
make run : to run the program
make clean: to delete the compiled execution

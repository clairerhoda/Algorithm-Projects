Project 4
By: Sijie Shang and Claire Rhoda

About:
Our Project 4 contains one C++17 file (main.cpp), a Makefile, and a PDF file showing 
pseudocode, mathematical anaylsis, and the output for each program. The C++17 file contains 
four different implementations of the tribonacci sequence. The first program solves it 
using a naive pattern. The second program solves it with a recursive solution directly 
implementing the recurrence relation defining the nth tribonacci number. The third 
implementation solves it also with a recursive solution but uses memoization. The last or 
fourth program uses the dynamic programming pattern to find the tribonacci sequence.

Installation:
Download this project as .tar and extract it.
Open the folder that has the main.cpp file and open a command window.
In terminal, type command: make all to compile the code
In terminal, type command: make run to run the program
In terminal, type command: make clean to delete the compiled execution

Project status:
All portions of our project carry out the required tasks.

Makefile Commands:
make all : to compile the program
make run : to run the program
make clean: to delete the compiled execution

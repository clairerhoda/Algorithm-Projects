Project 2
By: Sijie Shang and Claire Rhoda

About:
Our Project 2 contains two C++17 files (main.cpp and build.cpp). The build.cpp file contains 2 functions 
that are responsible for building the Ngraphs and weight matrices of problems 6-3(b) and 6-3(c) and the 
other function is responsible for displaying the weight matrices. The main.cpp contains 2 functions that 
produce and print the minimum spanning tree of each problem and the main function that carries out the calls
to each function in all files.
The Project 2 folder also contains the files ngraph.cpp and set_ops.hpp which makes it possible to build Ngraphs
and carry out functions that add vertices and edges to a graph.

The pdf file contains the hand written problems of 6-3(b) 6-3(c) that involve greating a minimum spanning tree.
The file output.txt is a text file showing output information for problems 6-3(a) and 6-3(b)
The Makefile is the last file responsible for carry out commands to build, run, and clean the programs.

Installation:
Download this project as .tar and extract it.
Open the folder that has the main.cpp file and open a command window.
In terminal, type command: make all to compile the code
In terminal, type command: make run to run the program
In terminal, type command: make clean to delete the compiled execution

Project status:
All portions of our project carry out the required tasks.

Makefile Commands:
make all : to compile the program
make run : to run the program
make clean: to delete the compiled execution
